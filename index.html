              <h3>The Basics</h3>
                <p>A lover of learning new things, I am never, ever bored. I'm a self-taught carpenter, an amateur ukelele player, and a home improvement junkie.  There is always something on my list of things I’d like to know more about.</p>
                <p> Born in Albany, NY, raised primarily in NH, and now a NC resident for over 20 years, I have settled here in Charlotte with my husband and two children.  A former mainframe developer, I am working hard to make the move to the ‘pretty side’ of computers and have studied web development to achieve that end.  These days if I’m not engaged in house projects, artsy/craftsy stuff with my daughter, or attending softball or soccer games, you will likely find me studying or coding!</p>

              <h3>The Nitty Gritty</h3>
              <div class="question">
                <div class="bio-button">How did this psychology major end up as a mainframe developer?</div>
                  <p class="answer">I studied psychology at UNC Wilmington; a fun major for those of us fascinated as to why people behave the way they do, but not exactly a well-planned line of study if seeking lucrative employment after graduation.  After a year and a half doing minimum-wage work, I was fortunate to be encouraged by a family friend to apply for a job with a company willing to train programmers needed to convert code for the impending doom of Y2K.  I studied COBOL on my own for three weeks, took their test, passed with flying colors and so was off to live in Boston for 10 weeks while I trained in mainframe development. Thus began my career as a developer!</p>
              </div><!-- end question -->

              <div class="question">
                  <div class="bio-button">The developer years...</div>
                  <p class="answer">My work as a developer was undoubtedly the most fun I’ve had in my career.  Hours pass easily when I’m coding.  After a number of years supporting and writing COBOL programs, I eventually moved into more of a QA role learning a scripting language similar to C++.  It was fun to learn a new language and I gained some valuable skills in requirements gathering and project management for a small upgrade to an online system.  And then motherhood called…</p>
                  </div>

                  <div class="question">
                  <div class="bio-button">What did I do with that mommy time?</div>
                  <p class="answer">In my stay-at-home years, you might say I put that psychology degree to work at last.  I have learned a great deal about working with difficult personalities and multi-tasking.  I also knew that eventually I would want to return to development and I took time to study web development related subjects online.  I also applied for and was accepted into a CPCC scholarship through the Reach IT program.  I studied C# for three months and hoped to land an entry level C# job upon completion.  </p>
                  </div>

                  <div class="question">
                  <div class="bio-button">What the heck is metadata management? My most recent contract...</div>
                  <p class="answer">What came my way before I had a chance to really explore a C# position was an offer to be a data analyst with Bank of America.  After nearly a decade at home, I felt it would be crazy to turn it down despite the lack of any coding.  I instead learned about metadata management while working half my contract with the data lineage team and half with data quality.  The position reinforced my belief that I am a fast learner, as I really knew nothing about these areas of banking. Both my managers told me they were sad to see me go when the time came, so I'm thinking I did alright! I loved working again, but I really missed development!</p>
                  </div>

                  <div class="question">
                  <div class="bio-button">And currently...</div>
                  <p class="answer">After a year of contracting, I opted to sign up for Tech Talent South’s Code Immersion course.  There I learned front-end development and a whole lot of Ruby on Rails.  We completed some fun projects like an ecommerce site and our own version of Facebook.  I returned as a TA for a later cohort to keep the details fresh and reinforce concepts.  Now in my free time, I still study…a lot.  I developed a site for a photographer friend during which I learned a great deal more about HTML and CSS, some Javascript and a little PHP.  I invested some time in learning more about SEO and I am currently diving deeper into Javascript.</p>
                  </div>

                  <div class="question">
                  <div class="bio-button">What am I looking for?</div>
                  <p class="answer">I am seeking a junior developer position.  I would also consider a less technical analyst position if it at least had me involved in application development.</br>
                  I am comfortable with HTML and CSS and think I could enjoy front-end work even more as I get to know JavaScript better.  I also like the added functionality that a back end language provides and while the transition from COBOL to OOP languages like C# and Ruby was initially jarring, I do feel progressively more at ease as I work with it.</p>
